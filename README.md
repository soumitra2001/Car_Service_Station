## Introduction
The Car Service Station project is a console-based Java application that helps manage car services. It allows users to input information such as car name, the number of services requested, and service codes. Based on this input, the application generates a bill for the car service. If the total bill amount exceeds 10,000 units, a complimentary cleaning service is provided for free.

This project showcases the use of object-oriented programming principles to create a structured and efficient solution for car service management.

Data Structure used in project: HashMap

## Features
* #### CarService Class: The core of the application is the CarService class, which contains the following attributes:

   * `service_code`: A unique code for each service.
   * `service_type`: The type of car service (Hatchback, Sedan, SUV).
   * `price`: The price of the service, which varies by car type.
* #### Bill Generation: Users can input car details, the number of services required, and service codes. The application calculates the total bill, taking into account the type of car and services chosen. If the total bill exceeds 10,000 units, a complimentary cleaning service is added.

* #### Object-Oriented Design: The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, including encapsulation and inheritance, to create a flexible and extensible solution.

## Usage
To use this Car Service Station application, follow these steps:
1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/soumitra2001/Car_Service_Station.git

```
2) Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3) Compile and run the Main class to start the application.

4) Follow the prompts to enter the car name, the number of services required, and service codes.

5) The application will generate a bill, including any complimentary cleaning services if the total bill exceeds 10,000 units.

6) Enjoy using the Car Service Station application!

## Implementation Details
* The project is implemented in Java, making use of object-oriented programming principles.
* The `CarService` class represents the core entity, with attributes to store service details.
* Inheritance is utilized for different car types (Hatchback, Sedan, SUV), allowing for flexible pricing.
* Input is obtained through the console, and user interactions are managed in the Main class.
* Error handling and validation are included to ensure the reliability of the application.
